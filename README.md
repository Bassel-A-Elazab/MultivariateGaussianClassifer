# MultivariateGaussianClassifer

# Overview 
    - I illustrated, and created Gaussian Distribution in one domension, And I explained how it worked,
      And more details in this link (https://github.com/Bassel-A-Elazab/GaussianClassiferFromScratchOneDimension)
    - I complete a gaussian but using multi-vairate/multi-dimension features, And looks at different between it and univariate gaussian.
    - I used a gaussian in two dimensions to look how it works, And looks at different calculations from the one-dimension.
    - Finally we can extend it for using more two dimenions, we created the basics and concepts.
    
# What is the multi-variate gaussian?
        
        - Is a vector in multiple normally distributed variables.
        - is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions.
