# MultivariateGaussianClassifer

# Overview 
   - I illustrated, and created Gaussian Distribution in one domension, And I explained how it worked,
      And more details in this link (https://github.com/Bassel-A-Elazab/GaussianClassiferFromScratchOneDimension)
   - I complete a gaussian but using multi-vairate/multi-dimension features, And looks at different between it and univariate gaussian.
   - I used a gaussian in two dimensions to look how it works, And looks at different calculations from the one-dimension.
   - We can extend it for using more two dimenions, we created the basics and concepts.
   - Finally gaussian in two dimensions is called (bivariate-normal distribution).
   
   
# What is the multi-variate gaussian?
        
      - Is a vector in multiple normally distributed variables.
      - is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions.
  
# How Multivariate Gaussian Classifer Works ?
    
   The concepts as discussed in one-dimensions (above link) with many different in equations.
   gaussian paramters are( mean, variance, and covariance matrix)
   
      - Step One:
         mean: 
         Calculates the mean for each variables,
         Then we have the mean vector consists of the means of each variable.
         mean = mean of [x1, x2, ..... , xn]
         
      - Step Two:
